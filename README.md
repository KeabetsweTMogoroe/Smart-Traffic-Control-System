# Smart-Traffic-Control-System
The Smart Traffic Control System is a project developed to optimize traffic flow using real-time data and intelligent traffic signals. This project includes a simulation created using Pygame to demonstrate the functionality of the system.

Features
Real-time Traffic Monitoring: Uses sensors (simulated) to gather real-time traffic data.
Intelligent Signal Control: Adjusts traffic signals based on traffic conditions to reduce congestion.
Pygame Simulation: A visual representation of the traffic control system using Pygame.
User Interface: Provides a simple UI for users to interact with the system.
